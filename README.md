# Blockly.IO
Most of the code written here is from [thekidofarcrania](https://github.com/thekidofarcrania/BlocklyIO). Great work!

This is a clone of the original Paper-IO released by Voodoo, except for one aspect. This will attempt to implement a multi-player aspect of the game (like a real IO game).

## Running

```bash
npm install
webpack #(in one tab)
node server.js #(in another tab)
```

## Goals
- [x] Support Mobile
- [x] Add webpack
- [x] Add toast notifications for errors and game notifications
- [ ] Move to ES Modules on the client
- [ ] Better dev experience for webpack
- [ ] Better game performance
- [ ] Allow more than 1 game at a time
